And my husband came up to me and he said, Shelly, you know I love you more than anything, right? I said, yeah, I do. He said, well I saw you getting dressed in the bathroom the other day and putting your panties on. And I tell you honey, it looked like you were smuggling and rang-a-tanging your damn panties. I mean, it was awful. I had to do something. So I went and I got me a wax, y'all. And when that girl ripped that damn wax off my poo-ntang, it felt like Satan had just kissed my poo-ntang. Oh, that was on fire. It was burning. But you know, I went home and got me some peas out of the freezer and I put it down there and that didn't help any. So I got my husband's jetty cooler and I soaked my poo-ntang in that and I tell you, I feel like a new woman today. I ain't doing that no more.",
